    2014 is a web application that is being developed as a tool to support the generation, selection and allocation of Undergraduate Level 3
    research and dissertation projects for the 2013-2014 session which starts in October.
  %p{style: "text-align:left;"}
    Registrations are welcome from all academic staff in the College of Engineering and all students, currently in Level 2 and Level S ("Year Out"),
    who will be expecting to take on an engineering project next year. By registering your Swansea University email address you will be
    added to our mailing list and informed when the site is open for project title collection (Staff) and project selection (Students).
  %p{style: "text-align:left;"}
    We anticipate that the invitations for joining the site will be issued to staff towards the start of July and Students towards the end of July.
    Project selection will start in August and will run through to September. Project allocation will commence once progression to Level 3 has been
    confirmed for all eligible students.
